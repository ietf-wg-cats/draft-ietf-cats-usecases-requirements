      "body": "Hi, co-authors,\r\n\r\nI 'm revisiting the parts describing the requirements of CATS metrics, namely section 5.2, 5.3, and 5.4. I've also collected I-Ds related to CATS metrics and listed in the following slide:\r\n<img width=\"1380\" alt=\"metric lifecycle\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eb9ac2d7-10fb-411c-be1b-d3e1f72b8668\">\r\n\r\nI think the current description on requirements of CATS metrics is not well-organized. For example, section 5.2 and 5.4 cross mentioning the metrics definition requirements. which should be merged. Section 5.3 is on metrics usage where metric collection, selection, and distribution are mentioned, but like the requirement on metric update are missing, which should be added.  \r\n\r\nAlso,  from the minutes of IETF120, some requirements mentioned in draft-du-cats-computing-modeling-description-03 need to be considered and merged into this document. \r\n\r\nhttps://datatracker.ietf.org/meeting/120/materials/minutes-120-cats-01.html\r\n\r\nTherefore, I have the following sugguestions:\r\n\r\n* section 5.2 is still on  metric definition and representation. but need to merge requirements from the current section 5.4 and also the requirements from draft-du-cats-computing-modeling-description-03\r\n\r\n* section 5.3 should be remained, and some sugguested modifications: \r\n     - in terms of metric collection, should we support bidirectional collection?\r\n     - we should add a new requirement on metric update.  \r\n     \r\n* in terms of metric accuracy assessment, I'm not sure where the requirement should be added, but I think it is important. Since we'd better not regulate CATS systems always using fixed metrics when providing services. They should change policies according to real behaviors.",

      "body": "Currently, in section 4.5 \"Computing-Aware AI Large Model Inference,\" it appears that training is exclusively reserved for the data center. However, there are relevant scenarios where the training (sometimes of already pre-trained models) occurs at the edge as well. Notably:\r\n\r\n(1) Fine tuning trains a pretrained model and can be done with smaller resources at the edge, and\r\n \r\n(2) Federated learning can perform continued training based on data sensed at the edge, further improving the model [1].\r\n \r\nBoth of these techniques benefit from running at the edge due to advantages such as privacy, low latency, lower utilization, cost and energy efficiency.\r\n\r\nThe suggestion here would be to:\r\n\r\n(1) Generalize the title of this section to avoid making it specific to \"Inference\". E.g., new title could be \"Computing-Aware Hybrid AI Workloads\", which would include inference, training and the fact that they can be hybrid (on-device or on one of the edge clouds) as mentioned in the section.\r\n\r\n(2) Adding the scenarios of fine tuning and federated learning as examples of training at the edge.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n[1] Federated Learning on the Edge, AAAI Spring Series Symposium 2024, March 25-27, 2024, Stanford University",

You may now have energy-aware decision (e.g., the cardinal being a Joule expression of your instance), compute-aware decision (e.g., the cardinal reflecting a deployed compute unit or even an instantaneous compute load), or a storage-aware decision (e.g., the cardinal expressing the occupancy of the associated hard disk). It can be whatever the application and vendor wants while the interface, conveying just a cardinal, remains the same.

My suggestion to use mere cardinals at the interface allows for interpreting those cardinals in any way you want at the application and vendor level. You may now have energy-aware decision (e.g., the cardinal being a Joule expression of your instance), compute-aware decision (e.g., the cardinal reflecting a deployed compute unit or even an instantaneous compute load), or a storage-aware decision (e.g., the cardinal expressing the occupancy of the associated hard disk). It can be whatever the application and vendor wants while the interface, conveying just a cardinal, remains the same. But having an interface where we allow for agreed/common metrics and proprietary ones at the same time creeps the vendor lock into the backdoor\r\n\r\nWhat is the difference? You still get proprietary interpretation of the same number which make it hard to interop, right?",

But i think the above needs a bit of rewording. I would say:\r\n\r\n\"R8. A model of the compute and network resources MUST be defined. Such a model MUST characterize how metrics are abstracted out from the compute and network resources. We refer to this model as the Resource Model.\"\r\n\r\nThen I would also add:\r\n\r\n\"R9: The Resource Model MUST be implementable in an interoperable manner. That is, independent implementations of the Resource Model must be interoperable.\"\r\n\r\n\"R9: The Resource Model MUST be executable in a scalable manner. That is, an agent implementing the Resource Model must be able to execute it at the required time scale and at an affordable cost (e.g., memory footprint, energy, etc.)\"\r\n\r\n\"R10: The Resource Model MUST be useful. That is, the metrics that an agent can obtain by executing the Resource Model must be useful to make node and path selection decisions.\"",
